# PSCoMiXX Creator — Full Rebuild Request

**From:** Claude (Contract Developer)
**To:** MoJo (Project Owner)
**Re:** Complete asset and information request for identical platform rebuild

-----

## Overview

To deliver a 1:1 rebuild of PSCoMiXX Creator that functions identically to your current Replit deployment, I need the following. I’ve organized this by category with explanations for why each item matters.

-----

## 1. Complete Source Code Export

I need the full codebase from Replit, not just select files.

### Frontend (`/client`)

|Files Needed              |Purpose                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|`/client/src/contexts/*`  |All React contexts (auth, project state, collaboration, etc.)                                            |
|`/client/src/hooks/*`     |Custom hooks (useAuth, useProject, useCollaboration, etc.)                                               |
|`/client/src/lib/*`       |Utility functions, API client, constants                                                                 |
|`/client/src/App.tsx`     |Router configuration and app shell                                                                       |
|`/client/index.html`      |Entry HTML with any meta tags, fonts, analytics                                                          |

|`vite.config.ts`          |Build configuration                                                                                      |
|`components.json`         |shadcn/ui configuration                                                                                  |

### Backend (`/server`)

-----

## 2. Database

### Schema Export

```bash
# Run this in Replit shell and send me the output:
npx drizzle-kit introspect:pg
```

Or export your complete `/shared/schema.ts` with all tables.

### Sample Data (Optional but Helpful)

- 2-3 sample projects of each type (comic, card, VN, CYOA, cover, motion)
- This helps me verify the data structures render correctly

### Migration History

- Any files in `/drizzle/` or migration folder
- Helps me understand schema evolution

-----

## 3. Static Assets

### Built-in Asset Library

|Folder             |Contents                               |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
|`/attached_assets/`|All 89 built-in assets mentioned in doc|
|Speech bubbles (48)|File names and folder structure        |
|Action effects (41)|POW, BAM, CRASH overlays, etc.         |

### UI Assets

|Asset Type      |Files Needed                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
|Logo(s)         |All variants (light, dark, icon-only)        |
|Favicon         |`.ico` and any PWA icons                     |
|Fonts           |If self-hosted (or confirm Google Fonts only)|
|Any custom icons|Beyond Lucide set                            |

### PWA Assets

|Files Needed   |Purpose                   |
|---------------|--------------------------|
|`manifest.json`|PWA configuration         |
|Service worker |If implemented            |
|App icons      |All sizes (192, 512, etc.)|

-----

## 4. Environment Variables

I need to know what variables exist, not necessarily the production values:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=               # Connection string format (I'll use my own)

# Auth
SESSION_SECRET=             # I'll generate my own

# Third-Party Services (list all that exist)
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=     # Google Analytics
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=          # If implemented
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=     # If implemented
CLOUDINARY_URL=             # If using for uploads
# Any others?
```

**Question:** Are there any API keys or service integrations not mentioned in the handoff doc?

-----

## 5. API Documentation

### Request/Response Examples

For each endpoint, I need a real example. Easiest method:

1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
1. Perform the action
1. Copy the request payload and response

**Priority endpoints:**

```
GET  /api/auth/user           → What does a logged-in user object look like?
POST /api/auth/login          → Request body format, response on success/failure
GET  /api/projects            → Full project list response with pagination?
GET  /api/projects/:id        → Single project with full JSONB data
POST /api/projects            → Required fields, what's auto-generated?
PATCH /api/projects/:id       → Partial update format
POST /api/ai/image            → Request format, response format
GET  /api/assets              → Asset list structure
```

### WebSocket Protocol

|Event Name|Direction      |Payload Shape|Purpose        |
|----------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
|`?`       |Client → Server|`?`          |Join session   |
|`?`       |Server → Client|`?`          |User joined    |
|`?`       |Both           |`?`          |Cursor position|
|`?`       |Both           |`?`          |Edit operation |

**Question:** Can you send me a screen recording or log of a collaboration session showing the WebSocket messages?

-----

## 6. Third-Party Service Details

### Pollinations.ai (AI Image Generation)

- Current prompt format being used
- Any rate limits you’ve encountered
- Base URL and endpoint structure

### Neon (PostgreSQL)

- Region your DB is hosted in
- Any specific connection pooling settings

### Planned Integrations

For anything marked “planned” that you want included:

- Stripe: Do you have a test account set up?
- Print-on-demand: Which service (Lulu, Printful, other)?
- Video export: Any specific format requirements?

-----

## 7. Design System Specifics

### Current Component Examples

Screenshots or exports of:

- Button states (default, hover, active, disabled)
- Form inputs (empty, filled, error, focus)
- Modal/dialog styling
- Card components
- Navigation (desktop and mobile)

### Any Design Files

- Figma link (if exists)
- Style guide document
- Brand guidelines

### Typography Verification

```css
/* Confirm these are correct: */
--font-display: 'Space Grotesk'
--font-body: 'Inter'
--font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono'
```

## 8. Business Logic Clarifications

### User Roles & Permissions

|Role          |What can they access?|What’s restricted?|
|--------------|---------------------|------------------|
|`creator`     |?                    |?                 |
|`admin`       |?                    |?                 |
|`student`     |?                    |?                 |
|`mentor`      |?                    |?                 |
|`school_admin`|?                    |?                 |
|`hub_staff`   |?                    |?                 |
|`pro_creator` |?                    |?                 |

### Legal Gate Flow

- What exactly must users accept before access?
- Is this per-session or one-time?
- Can they use any features before accepting?

### XP & Badge System

- How is XP calculated for each action?
- Badge unlock conditions
- Is there a level/rank system tied to XP?

-----

## 9. Testing & QA

### Known Issues

Any bugs or limitations I should be aware of that exist in current build?

### Test Accounts

Can you create me:

- 1 admin account (for full access testing)
- 1 creator account (for standard user flow)
- 1 student account (if permissions differ)

### Browser Support Requirements

Which browsers must work?

- Chrome (version?)
- Firefox?
- Safari?
- Edge?
- Mobile browsers?

-----

## 10. Deployment Target

### Where Will Rebuild Live?

- [ ] Replit (same as current)
- [ ] Netlify (frontend) + separate backend
- [ ] Vercel
- [ ] Self-hosted
- [ ] Other: ___________

### Domain Configuration

- Current domain: `pressstart.space`
- Any subdomains?
- SSL requirements?

-----

## Delivery Format Request

Easiest for you — pick one:

1. **Replit export:** Click the three dots → “Download as zip”
1. **GitHub repo:** Push your Replit to GitHub, share link
1. **File-by-file:** Upload key files here in batches
1. **Read access:** Add me as a collaborator on Replit (if possible)

-----

## Questions Before I Start

1. Is there any functionality in the live app that’s NOT documented in the handoff doc?
1. Are there multiple environments (dev/staging/prod)?
1. Who else is working on this codebase that I should coordinate with?
1. What’s the priority order if I need to build incrementally?
1. Are there any hard deadlines tied to specific features?

-----

Let me know what you can provide and I’ll get started with whatever’s available.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
