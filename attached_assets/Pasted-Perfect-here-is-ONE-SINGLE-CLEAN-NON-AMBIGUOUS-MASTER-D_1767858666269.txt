Perfect — here is ONE SINGLE, CLEAN, NON-AMBIGUOUS MASTER DOCUMENT that:

✅ Does NOT change or remove anything from the existing https://pressstart.space/
 app

✅ Adds early-adopter gating, pricing, desktop licensing, AppSumo, admin controls

✅ Includes a rollback + kill-switch strategy (explained clearly)

✅ Is already structured like GitHub Issues & milestones

✅ Can double as a formal SOW / dev contract

✅ Is written to minimize back-and-forth with Replit / Manus / any dev team

You can copy-paste this whole thing and be done.

PRESS START – COMIXX
ADDITIVE PLATFORM EXPANSION
MASTER BUILD SPEC + SOW + MILESTONES + SAFETY PLAN
0. ABSOLUTE NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE (READ FIRST)

This build is ADDITIVE ONLY.

The application currently live at:

https://pressstart.space/

is considered:

Production

Stable

Source of truth

Off-limits for redesign or refactor

This project:

❌ Does NOT replace the current app

❌ Does NOT redesign the UI

❌ Does NOT remove features

❌ Does NOT rename routes or tools

This project:

✅ Adds gates, wrappers, flags, and parallel systems

✅ Preserves all existing functionality

✅ Must not introduce regressions

If an existing user experiences any loss of functionality, that is a blocking bug.

1. PROJECT PURPOSE (WHY THIS EXISTS)

We are extending PRESS START – COMIXX to support:

Early-adopter controlled rollout (to avoid overload)

Free mobile / PWA access

Paid desktop access

Tiered monetization

AppSumo lifetime licenses

Admin control over scale

Future App Store readiness

All while keeping the current app intact.

2. PLATFORM STRATEGY (HIGH LEVEL)

Web / PWA → Primary (pressstart.space)

Mobile → Free, gated early access (PWA first, native later)

Desktop → Paid (same login, same backend)

AppSumo → Lifetime unlock via redemption codes

One backend.
One user system.
Multiple shells.

3. ACCESS & MONETIZATION MODEL
Mobile / PWA

Free

Early-adopter gated

Reading, light creation, sharing

No heavy export or commercial rights

Desktop

Paid tiers (login-based entitlements):

Creator

Pro

Studio

Lifetime (AppSumo)

Monetization moment:

Export, commercial use, batch tools, AI features.

4. EARLY-ADOPTER SYSTEM (ADDITIVE)
Purpose

Prevent overload, control rollout, prioritize partners.

Components

Waitlist

Invite codes

Admin approval

Daily caps

Rate limits

User States

pending

approved

active

blocked

Rules

Existing users = auto-approved

New users = gated

Admin controls approval velocity

5. ADMIN CONTROL ROOM (REQUIRED)

Admin must be able to:

View & approve waitlist

Generate invite codes

Set daily signup caps

Toggle features

Enable/disable monetization

View usage

Export CSVs

Send announcements

Admin panel must be role-based and isolated.

6. FEATURE GATING (NO UI REMOVAL)

Features are gated via entitlements, not UI deletion.

Example:

Export button stays visible

Clicking export checks entitlement

If locked → upgrade modal

No broken buttons.
No disappearing tools.

7. JOB QUEUE & LOAD PROTECTION

Heavy operations must be async:

Export

Rendering

AI tools

Flow:

User requests action

Job created

Status shown

Download link when complete

This prevents crashes and scaling issues.

8. SERVICE WORKER & PWA SAFETY
Known Issue

Partial responses (206) cannot be cached.

Requirement

Only cache responses with status === 200

Exclude fonts, media, streaming assets

This ensures:

No infinite loading

App Store compatibility

Clean installs

9. ROLLBACK + KILL-SWITCH STRATEGY (EXPLAINED)
What this means

A kill-switch allows us to instantly disable a new system without redeploying.

Why it matters

If:

Monetization breaks

Gating misfires

Admin settings cause lockouts

AppSumo codes malfunction

We must be able to revert instantly.

How it works (required)

Feature flags stored in DB or config

Middleware checks flags

Admin can toggle:

Early adopter gate ON/OFF

Payments ON/OFF

Export restrictions ON/OFF

Invite system ON/OFF

Rollback rule

Default state = existing app behavior

New systems fail open, not closed

If a flag breaks → turn it off → app behaves exactly as before.

10. GITHUB ISSUES / MILESTONES BREAKDOWN
MILESTONE 1 — SAFETY & FOUNDATION

Audit existing app

Add service worker fix

Add feature flag framework

Add admin role

MILESTONE 2 — EARLY ADOPTER SYSTEM

Waitlist table

Invite codes

Approval flow

Middleware gate

Admin UI

MILESTONE 3 — PRICING & ENTITLEMENTS

Tier definitions

Feature checks

Upgrade modals

Desktop entitlement readiness

MILESTONE 4 — JOB QUEUE

Async exports

Status tracking

Download delivery

MILESTONE 5 — APPSUMO

Code redemption

Lifetime tier

Admin visibility

MILESTONE 6 — ADMIN CONTROL ROOM

Dashboards

Caps

Toggles

CSV export

MILESTONE 7 — QA & ROLLBACK TESTING

Existing user regression test

Kill-switch test

Load simulation

Mobile PWA test

11. FORMAL SOW / DEV CONTRACT LANGUAGE
Scope

This project covers additive platform expansion only.

Out of Scope

UI redesign

Feature removal

App rewrite

Data migration that alters existing behavior

Acceptance Criteria

Existing users experience zero regressions

New users are gated correctly

Admin can control rollout

Rollback switches function

App remains stable under load

Ownership

PRESS START / MADMIXEDMEDIA retains 100% IP

No proprietary lock-in

Code must be portable

Termination Clause

If new systems cause instability and rollback fails, work must halt until resolved.

12. FINAL SUMMARY (FOR DEV TEAMS)

“Treat the existing PRESS START – COMIXX app as sacred.
Add systems around it, not inside it.
Every new feature must be optional, gated, reversible, and safe.”
