Perfect, that’s the rest of the Voltron pieces 🧠⚡️
Here’s an **updated, copy-paste ready brief for Claude** that *adds* those four links as ecosystem tools + future integration targets.

## ✅ PSCoMiXX CREATOR – MASTER BRIEF (INTEGRATION VERSION)

**Project:** PSCoMiXX Desktop Creator – Comics, Cards, Covers, Visual Novels & Video
**Primary Reference Site:** [https://www.pscomixx.com/](https://www.pscomixx.com/)
**Codebase:** Attached `comic-app` folder from `comic-app-complete (7).zip`

### 🌐 Ecosystem & Integration Targets (Must Study & Respect)

In addition to the main codebase and pscomixx.com, you must also treat these as **core references + future integration surfaces**:

* **[https://comixx.website/](https://comixx.website/)** – marketing/landing presence for the brand.
* **[https://pscomixx.online/](https://pscomixx.online/)** – PSCoMiXX creator/experience surface (web).
* **[https://psstreaming.online/](https://psstreaming.online/)** – community / reader / monetization platform for publishing comics/cards/VNs.
* **[https://pscomixx-6hljpllm.manus.space/](https://pscomixx-6hljpllm.manus.space/)** – current Manus-built app (functional reference for flows and tools).

> **Instruction:**
> Open and study each of these URLs.
>
> * Mirror the **feature set, naming, and user flows** where they overlap with the desktop app.
> * Do **not** remove or ignore any capability that clearly exists in those tools unless explicitly deprecated.
> * Design the new desktop app so it can **integrate smoothly** with these platforms (export formats, APIs, auth, etc.).

## 1. Role & Goal

You are an AI engineer rebuilding and upgrading my **desktop PSCoMiXX Creator app**. The app must support:

* Comic Page Builder (image + video + drawing in panels)
* Cover Creator
* Trading Card Creator (with evolution-ready data)
* **Visual Novel / Story Creator (branching)**
* (If present) Separate CYOA builder
* User accounts/logins
* **Admin login + analytics (my account only)**
* Clean integration with:

  * PSCoMiXX web properties
  * PSStreaming reader/monetization
  * Existing Manus prototype behavior

You will:

1. Study the repo + internal docs.
2. Study **pscomixx.com** + the four extra URLs above.
3. Rebuild the desktop app so it is:

   * Stable
   * Easy to use
   * Feature-complete
   * Integration-ready for the rest of the ecosystem.

---

## 2. Things To Read First (Repo)

Inside `comic-app/`:

* `Comic_Creator_Documentation.md`
* `COMMUNITY_APP_BUILD_SHEET.md`
* `CRITICAL_FIXES.md`
* `CONTINUE.md`
* `CARD_FILE_FORMAT.md`
* Any docs referring to:

  * Visual Novels / Story Mode
  * CYOA / branching
  * Video features
  * Export/publish

Use these plus the live sites as a **combined spec**. When in doubt, keep the **superset** of all described features.

---

## 3. Desktop-Only Creator Hub

This project is for **desktop** (mouse/keyboard + Wacom/stylus). Mobile is handled by a **separate app**.

Main modes (from a single hub/dashboard):

* Comic Builder (image + video + drawing panels)
* Cover Creator
* Trading Card Creator
* **Visual Novel Creator**
* CYOA / branching tools (if present in docs/code)

All modes must:

* Save & load projects reliably
* Support undo/redo
* Export for print + web
* Be aware that finished works may be published to **psstreaming.online** and/or web PSCoMiXX apps.

---

## 4. Auth, Users & Admin

### 4.1 User Accounts

Implement/complete:

* Email + password signup/login/logout.
* Hashed passwords, secure sessions/JWT.
* User profile (display name, avatar, optional bio).
* User library:

  * Shows Comics, Covers, Cards, Visual Novels, CYOA projects.
  * Filter by type, date, title.

### 4.2 Admin Role (My Account Only)

Create an **admin-only** role tied to my email/account:

* Admin dashboard:

  * Total users.
  * Total projects by type (comic/card/cover/VN/CYOA).
  * New projects per day/week/month.
  * Export/publish counts.
  * Approximate storage use.
* Admin tools:

  * View users list + basic stats (how many projects).
  * View recent activity (e.g., “user X created comic Y”).
  * Optional: soft-disable user via DB flag.

Secure all admin endpoints with role checks.

---

## 5. Creation Modes (All Must Be Preserved & Polished)

### 5.1 Comic Builder (Image + Video + Drawing)

Panels & Layouts:

* Common panel templates (1–4, grids, manga layouts).
* Ability to change layouts mid-project without breaking content too badly.

Per-panel content types:

1. **Image**

   * Backgrounds from library/uploads.

2. **Drawing Layer**

   * Brush/eraser, color, size, opacity.
   * Stylus/Wacom support where possible.
   * Inline drawing mode vs full-blank mode (fixed as per `CRITICAL_FIXES.md`).

3. **Video**

   * Drop in video clips into panels (like in current Manus prototype).
   * Basic control: start/end, autoplay flag for reader.
   * Text/bubbles overlay on top.

4. **Text & Bubbles**

   * Speech bubbles, captions, SFX text.
   * Multiple fonts, size, alignment, outline/shadow.
   * Drag/resize/rotate.

Canvas behavior:

* Drag/resize/rotate elements.
* Snap guides.
* Zoom + pan.
* Robust undo/redo.

### 5.2 Cover Creator

* Dedicated cover mode:

  * Hero art (image or composition).
  * Title, subtitle, author text.
  * Logo/badge.
  * QR code (linking out to psstreaming/pscomixx).

* Live preview (no delayed updates).

* Export:

  * Print-ready PNG/JPEG.
  * Web preview.

### 5.3 Trading Card Creator (Evolution-Ready)

* Card templates (by rarity/frame).

* Fields: name, art, stats, rarity, flavor text, type/tags.

* Card evolution:

  * Structure for multiple stages (base → advanced → legendary).
  * Shared card ID; different visuals/stats per stage.

* Use `CARD_FILE_FORMAT.md` for `.card` I/O.

* Export:

  * High-res PNG for print.
  * Web-size preview.

### 5.4 Visual Novel Creator (Flagship)

* Project structure:

  * Scenes (nodes).
  * Characters (with sprite sets).
  * Backgrounds.
  * Dialogue lines.
  * Choices/branches.

* Scene editor:

  * Background per scene.
  * List or graph of scenes.
  * Sequence of dialogue entries.

* Dialogue editor:

  * Speaker, text, sprite/pose, position (L/C/R).
  * Add/duplicate/reorder lines.
  * In-app playtest.

* Characters:

  * Character library with name/color.
  * Multiple expression sprites.

* Choices & branching:

  * At certain lines, present choices.
  * Each choice links to another scene or point.
  * Some form of node/graph visualization is ideal.

* Optional future variables:

  * Flags/variables with simple conditions.
  * Design data model to allow this later.

* Exports:

  * JSON of full VN (scenes, dialogue, choices, characters, backgrounds).
  * Optional asset bundle ZIP.
  * Internal “Play” mode for testing.

### 5.5 CYOA Builder (If Separate)

* If docs/code include a distinct CYOA builder:

  * Keep it.
  * Nodes = pages/sections; edges = choices.
  * Nodes may reference comic pages, VN scenes, or text.
  * Share data where possible but don’t remove either VN or CYOA without clear reason.

---

## 6. Export, Publish & Integration

### 6.1 Export Types

* **Comics**

  * Page PNGs.
  * Multi-page PDF.
  * ZIP bundle.

* **Covers**

  * Print PNG/JPEG.
  * Web preview.

* **Cards**

  * Print PNG.
  * Web preview.

* **Visual Novels / CYOA**

  * JSON project export.
  * Optional bundle ZIP.

Add progress UI + error handling for all exports.

### 6.2 Integration with PSStreaming & Web Apps

Design export/publish functions to integrate with:

* **[https://psstreaming.online/](https://psstreaming.online/)**

  * Acts as community/reader/monetization platform.
  * Provide a “Publish to PSStreaming” or “Publish to Community” action that:

    * Packages project data (e.g., JSON, PNGs/PDFs).
    * Adds metadata:

      * title, description, tags, age rating, language, creator ID, project type.
    * Hits a configurable API endpoint (to be wired later).

* **[https://pscomixx.online/](https://pscomixx.online/)** + **[https://comixx.website/](https://comixx.website/)**

  * Web surfaces that may embed or host viewer/editor functionality.
  * Ensure:

    * Data formats are stable and well-documented.
    * Deep-linking is possible (e.g., project IDs that can be opened on the web side).

* **[https://pscomixx-6hljpllm.manus.space/](https://pscomixx-6hljpllm.manus.space/)**

  * Treat as a **functional reference**:

    * Match or exceed current UX flows (how users create, edit, export).
    * Rebuild features natively in this new codebase (don’t depend on Manus at runtime).

---

## 7. Desktop UX, Dashboard & QoL

* Dashboard:

  * Thumbnails for all project types.
  * Filters by type/status/date.

* Autosave:

  * On major actions or interval.
  * Clear “Saved / Unsaved” indicator.

## 8. Architecture & Docs

* Stack: React + Vite + TypeScript + Express + Drizzle + DB + S3.

* Use `.env` for secrets.

* Shared TS types for:

  * Users, projects, comics, cards, VNs, CYOAs, metadata.

* Validate everything client & server side.

* Update docs:

  * Setup / run.
  * Architecture overview.
  * Per-mode usage guides.
  * Data contracts for integration with:

    * pscomixx(.com/.online)

---

## 9. Deliverables

By the end, I should have:

1. A stable, desktop-only PSCoMiXX Creator app with:

   * Comic, Cover, Card, VN & CYOA creation.
2. Working:

   * User auth.
   * **Admin analytics dashboard**.
3. Reliable export & publish flows targeted at:

   * psstreaming.online (community/reader/monetization).
   * pscomixx web properties.
4. Clean, documented data formats + endpoints so future tools/plugins can hook in easily.

---

**End of brief.**
Use the repo, **pscomixx.com**, and the four integration URLs together. If a feature exists in any of them, treat it as required or future-critical and keep the system forward-compatible.
