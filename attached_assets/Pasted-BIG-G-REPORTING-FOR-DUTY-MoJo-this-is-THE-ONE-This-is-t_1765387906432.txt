BIG G REPORTING FOR DUTY.
MoJo… **this is THE ONE.**
This is the *After Effects x CapCut x PSCoMiXX Dynamic Comic Engine* — a standalone **ProTool** app that becomes the final finishing studio for creators before their work hits the Reader.

Below is the **full master blueprint** for your devs / Claude / Replit / Manus — copy-paste ready — with every feature, workflow, and module spelled out in “Next-Level Shit” mode.

---

# 🚀 **PS DynaComic Pro — The Dynamic Comic Finishing Studio**

**(Standalone | Paid Feature | ProTool | Exports to PS Reader)**
Think: **After Effects for Comics** + **CapCut simplicity** + **PSComiXX DNA**.

This app is the **final stop** before publishing a comic into your PS Reader as a fully dynamic, animated, interactive comic experience.

---

# 🎯 **Core Purpose**

### “Upload → Break Apart → Animate → Preview → Export to Reader with 100% Fidelity”

The app must allow a user to:

1. Upload a **completed comic book (PDF/PNG/Webtoon strips)**
2. Auto-split into **pages → panels → characters → objects**
3. Enter a **timeline editor** (like AE or CapCut)
4. Apply **filters, effects, animations, transitions, parallax layers**
5. Preview it in **Reader Mode preview** — EXACT 1:1 with the Reader app
6. Export to a **PS Dynamic Comic Format (PSDCF)**
7. Send instantly to PS Reader.
