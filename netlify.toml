# Netlify Configuration for PSCoMiXX Creator
# 
# IMPORTANT: This app has a backend server (Express + PostgreSQL)
# For full functionality, Replit's built-in publishing is recommended
# as it runs the complete stack including the database.
#
# This Netlify config is for frontend-only static deployment.
# API endpoints (/api/*) will NOT work without additional serverless setup.
